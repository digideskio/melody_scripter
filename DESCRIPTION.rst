Melody Scripter
===============

*Melody Scripter* is a Python library which reads tunes written in a simple
sequential format consisting of notes, bar lines and chords, with optional
prelude lines specifying song and track properties.

Currently the only functionality of *Melody Scripter* is to output Midi files.

However, it has been written with the intention to facilitate the analysis
of musical items, providing a relatively straightforward object model
of a tune and the components of the tune.
